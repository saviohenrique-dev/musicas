Down on the West Coast they got a saying
"If you're not drinking then you're not playing"
But you've got the music, you've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West Coast I get this feeling like
It all could happen that's why I'm leaving you for the music
You for the music it's true, it's true
I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I'm feeling like there's no one else that brings me higher than higher
Te deseo, cari√±o, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la la
On the balcony and I'm sayin
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love, I'm in love)
Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their queens of Saigons
But you've got the music, you've got the music in you
Don't you
You pull me close, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Hold me close and you say, hush baby, hush
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby. I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
